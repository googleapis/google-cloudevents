      // to the CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary Content Mode
      // (https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md#31-binary-content-mode).
      // In this representation, all fields except the `data` and
      // `datacontenttype` field on the message are mapped to HTTP request
      // headers with a prefix of `ce-`.
      //
      // To construct the HTTP request payload and the value of the content-type
      // HTTP header, the payload format is defined as follows:
      // 1) Use the output_payload_format_type on the Pipeline.Destination if it
      //    is set, else:
      // 2) Use the input_payload_format_type on the Pipeline if it is set,
      //    else:
      // 3) Treat the payload as opaque binary data.
      //
      // The `data` field of the message is converted to the payload format or
      // left as-is for case 3) and then attached as the payload of the HTTP
      // request. The `content-type` header on the HTTP request is set to the
      // payload format type or left empty for case 3). However, if a mediation
      // has updated the `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is
      // not the same as the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the
      // payload format type, then the `content-type` header on the HTTP request
      // is set to this `datacontenttype` value. For example, if the
      // `datacontenttype` is "application/json" and the payload format type is
      // "application/json; charset=utf-8", then the `content-type` header on
      // the HTTP request is set to "application/json; charset=utf-8".
      //
      // If a non-empty binding expression is specified then this expression is
      // used to modify the default CloudEvent HTTP Protocol Binding Binary
      // Content representation.
      // The result of the CEL expression must be a map of key/value pairs
      // which is used as follows:
      // - If a map named `headers` exists on the result of the expression,
      // then its key/value pairs are directly mapped to the HTTP request
      // headers. The headers values are constructed from the corresponding
      // value type's canonical representation. If the `headers` field doesn't
      // exist then the resulting HTTP request will be the headers of the
      // CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode representation of the final
      // message. Note: If the specified binding expression, has updated the
      // `datacontenttype` field on the message so that it is not the same as
      // the payload format type but it is still a prefix of the payload format
      // type, then the `content-type` header in the `headers` map is set to
      // this `datacontenttype` value.
      // - If a field named `body` exists on the result of the expression then
      // its value is directly mapped to the body of the request. If the value
      // of the `body` field is of type bytes or string then it is used for
      // the HTTP request body as-is, with no conversion. If the body field is
      // of any other type then it is converted to a JSON string. If the body
      // field does not exist then the resulting payload of the HTTP request
      // will be data value of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
      // representation of the final message as described earlier.
      // - Any other fields in the resulting expression will be ignored.
      //
      // The CEL expression may access the incoming CloudEvent message in its
      // definition, as follows:
      // - The `data` field of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed
      // using the `message.data` value. Subfields of `message.data` may also be
      // accessed if an input_payload_format has been specified on the Pipeline.
      // - Each attribute of the incoming CloudEvent message can be accessed
      // using the `message.<key>` value, where <key> is replaced with the
      // name of the attribute.
      // - Existing headers can be accessed in the CEL expression using the
      // `headers` variable. The `headers` variable defines a map of key/value
      // pairs corresponding to the HTTP headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding
      // Binary Content Mode representation of the final message as described
      // earlier. For example, the following CEL expression can be used to
      // construct an HTTP request by adding an additional header to the HTTP
      // headers of the CloudEvent HTTP Binding Binary Content Mode
      // representation of the final message and by overwriting the body of the
      // request:
      //
      // ```
      // {
      //   "headers": headers.merge({"new-header-key": "new-header-value"}),
      //   "body": "new-body"
      // }
      // ```
      // - The default binding for the message payload can be accessed using the
      // `body` variable. It conatins a string representation of the message
      // payload in the format specified by the `output_payload_format` field.
      // If the `input_payload_format` field is not set, the `body`
      // variable contains the same message payload bytes that were published.
      //
      // Additionally, the following CEL extension functions are provided for
      // use in this CEL expression:
      // - toBase64Url:
      //   map.toBase64Url() -> string
      //     - Converts a CelValue to a base64url encoded string
      // - toJsonString: map.toJsonString() -> string
      //     - Converts a CelValue to a JSON string
      // - merge:
      //   map1.merge(map2) -> map3
      //     - Merges the passed CEL map with the existing CEL map the
      //     function is applied to.
      //     - If the same key exists in both maps, if the key's value is type
      //     map both maps are merged else the value from the passed map is
      //     used.
      // - denormalize:
      //   map.denormalize() -> map
      //     - Denormalizes a CEL map such that every value of type map or key
      //     in the map is expanded to return a single level map.
      //     - The resulting keys are "." separated indices of the map keys.
      //     - For example:
      //       {
      //         "a": 1,
      //         "b": {

      //         "e.1": 5
      //       }
      // - setField:
      //   map.setField(key, value) -> message
      //     - Sets the field of the message with the given key to the
      //     given value.
